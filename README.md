This repository is a contribution to the [Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) Global Hackathon 2022](https://aws-asdi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover). 
The idea is to support the UN Sustainable Development Goal Nr. 11 [Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_11) by analyzing the development of urban green areas by the example of [Freising](https://www.freising.de/) a small city near Munich, Germany.

## Project scope
The goal is to collect and analyze data on urban green spaces and visualize it in an appealing way with interactive maps and graphics so that the resulting information is easy to understand.
The methods and outcomes of this project shall be transferable to other cities. This is ensured by a high level of automation of the data processing and the usage of global avaliable datasets.

## Data & Methods 
The information shall be derived with the support of the following available datasets of ASDI:
- [GADM - Global Administrative Boundaries](https://gadm.org/data.html)
- [ESA Worldcover 2020](https://registry.opendata.aws/esa-worldcover/)
- [Sentinel 1](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-1/)
- [Sentinel 2 COGs](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs/)

The following methods shall be evaluated:
- machine learning / deep learning based classification
- classic remote sensing analysis & statistial methods
- change detection
- development of a processing chain and a web app

## Steps
- create project logo
- checkout available resources on AWS
- evaluate data & methods
- formulate technical road map
